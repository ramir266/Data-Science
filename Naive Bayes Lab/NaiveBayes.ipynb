    "The Frequenist inference is based on the idea of long-term frequencies whereas the Bayesian inference is rooted from the degrees of belief and degrees of logical support. According to the frequentist definition of probability, only repeatable random events (like the result of flipping a coin) have probabilities. These probabilities are equal to the long-term frequency of occurence of the events in question. Frequentists don't attach probabilities to hypotheses or to any fixed but unknown values in general. In contrast, Bayesians view probabilities as a more general conecpt. As a Bayesian, you can use probabilities to represent the uncertainty in any event or hypothesis. An example is assigning probabilities to non-repeatable events, such as someone winning a presidential race. Orthodox frequentists would claim that such probabilities don't make sense because the event is not repeatable. In my opinion, I would side with the Bayesian theory because I believe that you can still calculate probabilities to any event or hypothesis. I do not believe that the only way you can calculate the true probability is if there is only repeatable random events.  "
